## Stories from some new member of our community


**[emarenghi](https://community.humanetech.com/u/emarenghi)**: *"Hi all! I’m Eve. I’m a student at NYU in an applied data science master’s program and previously worked in digital analytics. Since starting school I’ve been learning data science and machine learning. At the same time, I’m experiencing and learning about the negative impacts of social media on mental health, the deterioration of relationships at the hands of technology, privacy and ethics issues, etc… the list goes on.
I hope to pursue a career where I can study and educate others about the implications of technology and artificial intelligence on society. It’s comforting to discover there are many others who share my concerns and who are proactively working to address the challenges ahead.
Looking forward to learning from you all and potentially meeting some New Yorkers in person!"*


**[SaintPirelli](https://community.humanetech.com/u/saintPirelli)**: *"Hi, I am Konstantin, I live in Vienna, Austria and non-techy day job, but like to code and create stuff in my spare time. I was first made aware of the problem of tech influencing my life in various negative ways by Cal Newport’s book “Deep Work” and then just fell down the rabbit hole and improving my life by sparing unhealthy technology ever since. I think this issue is one of the most pressing ones of our time so I am eager to devote time and effort to it."*


**[Zosia](https://community.humanetech.com/u/Zosia)**: *"Hello! My name is Sophie and I joined this community recently :blush: I was so stoked to find you all!
I was born into a generation and an area of London that didn’t really have their first PC until the ages of 14-16 and even then, it was an activity usually only enjoyed on a rainy day.
I did not have my first smart phone until I was 21 years old. I am now 27 and finding it extremely hard to watch everyone around me allow it to completely consume them. I am getting tired of having to be constantly available and questioned as if there is a problem if I do not respond within the hour. I am getting tired of talking to people whilst they scroll through their phones. It is becoming a very lonely world.
My sister is 13 and is amongst the first generation to be a digital native. She is currently being treated for anxiety and depression as she struggles to socialise without her smartphone. This is something I am hearing about more and more so I am very appreciative to organisations such as this one that are striving for a healthier future with tech.
I do not work in tech nor am I a very tech savvy person. I have just graduated in music management but have started to rethink my career choices. I guess I haven’t worked that out yet, but I know I would like advocate a healthier approach with tech and help educate society on the detrimental impact it can have.
I now live in Southampton and was hoping to set up maybe some sort of group for people in the Hampshire area who would like to meet others and have discussions who also feel this way.
I will be attending the London meet up tomorrow, hope to meet some of you there :blush:"*
