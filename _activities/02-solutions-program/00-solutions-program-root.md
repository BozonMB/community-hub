## Ideas

**Note**: We have plenty of ideas at the Humane Tech Community. Many of these may be turned into true projects. Whether that happens depends on member interest and activity.

We will move all our interesting ideas from our [Discussion Forum](https://community.humanetech.com) to a dedicated [Community Building](https://github.com/humanetech-community/engagement-ideas) repository. For a quick overview of (just some of) our ideas, see this for now:
