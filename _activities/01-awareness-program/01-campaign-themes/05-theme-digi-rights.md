## Summary 

<!-- Clear and concise explanation in 1-3 lines of text -->

Using the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html) as our guideline to define our Digital Rights and lay the foundation for new laws and law enforcement tools.

## Topics

<!-- Bullet list with (humane) tech topics and/or harms that are targeted -->

- Human Rights
- Digital Rights
- Advocacy
- Internet Regulations

## Objectives

<!-- Bullet list of what to achieve with the campaigns in this theme, separated by empty lines. -->

- Create awareness of the implications of new (internet) technology to our fundamental Human Rights.

- Show how the articles of the Human Rights Declaration apply to the digital realm.

- Translate Human Rights articles to texts that directly relate to Digital Rights.

- Use the Digital Human Rights articles we create as promotional texts for advocay, input to lawmakers.

## Description

<!-- A longer, more elaborate description (one or more paragraphs of text) -->

We spend way to much time staring at our screens, be it on smartphones or laptops. This has serious consequences for our health. People develop sleep disorders, eyestrain and even blindness, and a humpback neck.

A little more awareness of our behavior could already do wonders, and there are many easy to apply exercises and tips to change habits and behavior and alleviate problems before they occur.

## Strategy

<!-- (optional) If there is a common strategy, outline it here (one or more paragraphs of text, use formatting - like lists - where appropriate). Leave the placeholder text if this section is not needed. -->

- Campaigns within this theme do not serve to create actual human rights amendments, but rather as marketing and promotion of more targeted advocacy projects, and to steer focused discussions.

## Campaigns

<!-- Hyperlinked ToC to past, ongoing and future campaigns. Update this later to reflect changes. -->

- [Campaign 1](campaign1-url) - TODO

## Resources

<!-- (optional) Links to relevant folders, files and external information, or leave the placeholder text. -->
