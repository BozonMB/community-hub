The Awareness Program is an ongoing activity run by the [Humane Tech Community](https://community.humanetech.com). In this space our members collaborate to create (social) media campaigns and other deliverables that aim to inform the wider public on the problems that come with modern technology and the need to address these by applying Humane Technology.

Of course, any non-members can contribute just as well. Though - if you are as concerned as us about the impact of technology on our society - we heartily invite you to [join our community](/join/)!

## Campaign themes

Every campaign has a **Theme** and themes can have multiple campaigns. Themes have high-level, long-term objectives to be attained by execution of their related Campaigns. Hence they are long-lived and determine the focus and scope of the campaigns that adhere to the theme.

## Campaigns

Campaigns are at the heart of the Awareness Program. They are where members team up to plan coordinated activities. Each **Campaign** has its own goals and deliverables to be produced when the campaign executes. Each campaign defines its own campaign strategy. Campaigns are less abstract concept than a campaign themes, and they can be short-lived, only executing to produce their deliverables.
