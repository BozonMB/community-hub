## Description

<!-- A longer, more elaborate description (one or more paragraphs of text) -->

A good way to promote HTC and CHT and at the same time draw attention to technology harms or their solutions, is to have branded goodies that can be dealt out at e.g. meetup events (e.g. stickers), downloaded (e.g. screensaver), or worn to make a statement (e.g. apparel such as T-shirts or baseball caps).

This campaign is about creating such goodies in crowdsourced manner and fill the Goodie Bag of the community.
