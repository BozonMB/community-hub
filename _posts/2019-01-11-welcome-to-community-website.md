This first article on our Community Blog will introduce you to what our community is all about, and what our future plans are. We are involved in **Humane Technology** and will explain what that means. You'll see that we have a challenging, but exciting road ahead of us on our mission to _"Align Technology to Humanity's Best Interests"_.

## What we do and why

Our community fights the [Harms of Technology](https://ledger.humanetech.com/) and helps ensure that it does not control us. Instead technology should serve humanity, in ways that are beneficial to us all: Our members are on a quest for Humane Technology. 

We live in a fast-paced world, where technological innovations are rolled out with ever increasing speed, leading us to a future where science fiction becomes reality. Science and technology have huge improvements in store for us, to how we may lead our daily lives. But not all promises becomes reality, and with this rapid technological change many unforeseen problems arise. Disruption - traditionally seen as something negative - now has positive meaning, and is something to strive for. It defines success. Looking at how modern businesses operate nowadays, to try to get the upper hand, it is almost as if they _all_ have adopted Facebook's credo of _'Moving fast and break things'_.

And things have been broken. All this disruption has had great impact on our society. Look around you. What do you see? People absorbed in their smartphones.. Everywhere. Perusing their social networks - where their friends are - for whom they have imagoes to uphold. User profiles that are not really them. Fake reflections on how they want to be seen, and behind which they can hide their true identities, their vulnerabilities and real feelings. Communications has become shallow and remote as the digital world eats away at the time we are in actual reality, the here and now, celebrating life and talking to each other.

We all know this to a certain extent, yet we let it happen. We let us get driven further into this digital dreamscape that is forming. Have it absorb more of our lives. We can't help ourselves. We cannot resist the temptation, the lure. It is present, lurking in all the things we find online. A mirage.

The reason behind this is, that our minds - having evolved slowly over aeons - are truly hacked by clever technologies that hijack your attention. Tuned on purpose by scientists and experts who - sometimes unwittingly - are working for powerful and dominant players - the Big Tech corporations and many others in the IT field. And governments too. Power and money are their real drivers, and there is a lot to be made.

Surveillance capitalism - the name we gave to this phenomenon - is gaining strength, stripping us of privacy and freedoms. If not actively resisted and replaced with something better - offering a brighter blueprint of our future - it will inevitable give rise to things more dangerous and lasting: Technological dystopia ensues.

## How we started

We are affiliated to the [Center for Humane Technology](https://humanetech.com) (or CHT). The CHT was founded in February 2018 by a [team of deeply concerned former tech insiders](http://humanetech.com/problem#team) led by [Tristan Harris](http://www.tristanharris.com/) (former Design Ethicist at Google). At that same time the [community forum](https://community.humanetech.com) was created as a place to discuss the many harms of technology that ail people and society. Many interesting discussions were held since that day, involving a broad spectrum of problems and their solutions.

We existed, however, merely as a discussion forum. But that changed in October 2018, when the community [repositioned](https://community.humanetech.com/t/community-position-statement-contribution-guidelines-forum-improvements/2759) itself and became a separate entity known as the **Humane Tech Community**, abbreviated as HTC. The Humane Tech Community is still closely affiliated to CHT, but whereas CHT works from the top down, we are going from the bottom-up, as a grassroots movement. Our community is inclusive and open to everyone and we work entirely in the public domain.
