## Summary

![Humane Tech Community Open Canvas](/assets/images/blog/position-statement/humanetech-community-open-canvas-summary.png) 

## 'Product'

### Problems

Our embracing of exponential technology innovations that put **profit over people** are causing us increasing harms that we are unaware of, or feel powerless to change. These harms affect:

1. **Wellbeing**: prolonged social media and device use is afflicting mental and physical health and deteriorating our social skills.

2. **Freedom**: surveillance capitalism is destroying privacy, wasting our attention, diminishes our rights, and increases inequality.

3. **Society**: fake news, disinformation, censorship is eroding trust and social norms, even civics and democracy itself are at risk and we can be manipulated by malicious actors.

### Solutions

We **educate** people, creating **awareness** on how tech harms affect them and what they can do to mitigate or entirely avoid them.

We actively collect, create and improve **solutions** in cooperation with many **partners** and we will then **promote** them to the broader public - our audience - and stimulate their widespread use.

These solutions, when technological in nature, are called **humane technology**.

### Key metrics

- Growth of public **audience** receiving our message
- Growth of active **community members** that contribute
- **Retention** of active members over longer periods
- Number of **partners** that we actively cooperate with
- Number of successful **campaigns** (based on individual criteria)
- Surveys on **clarity** of message, **quality** of solutions, continuous feedback

### Key resources

Resources needed for a MVP:

- **Community team** to facilitate, organize and moderate
- **Volunteers** documenting, blogging, writing articles
- **Technical volunteers** to design / develop website
- **Campaigners** to help spread the message
