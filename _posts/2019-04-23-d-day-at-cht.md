Today is a very special day. After a full year operating mostly under the radar — preparing, strategizing, planning - the Center for Humane Technology (or CHT) is finally going public with its Roadmap. From today onwards for everyone working in the sector there will be **A New Agenda for Tech!** Take notice.

The entire website of the CHT that for so long clearly highlighted the dark sides of technology and promised a new way forward, has been taken offline and just shows the notice you see above. For now.. because when the Livestream starts the new website will come online too. For those of you who did not sign up for the CHT newsletter when the site was still active, here is the announcement mail sent to all Humane Tech community members:

>Hello friends, 
>
>We are thrilled to invite you to an important livestream on [humanetech.com](https://humanetech.com) at 11 am PT on April 23. 
>
>Center for Humane Technology Co-Founders **Tristan Harris** and **Aza Raskin** will outline a new, more hopeful path for technology at SFJAZZ Center in San Francisco in front of more than 300 tech luminaries, including founders, CEOs, VCs, designers, and innovators.
>
>**Please join us online on Tuesday and be part of history in the making!** 

Our Community Team was informed about this event beforehand, and we know it is going to be BIG! Besides the crème de la crème of the tech world, the event will get _huge_ press attention, because:

> **Humane Technology will be truly put on the map now!**

This event is the reason our team went into overdrive to reorganize our [discussion forum](https://humanetech.community) and our [Community Hub](https://community.humanetech.com/t/3824) website. We are continuing to build this, and YOU can help.

## Our relationship with the Center for Humane Technology

As most of you know, our community was founded by the Center for Humane Technology in February last year. In the course of the year, we reorganized ourselves as the independently operating Humane Tech Community.

Whereas we are a grassroots movement, going bottom-up, crowdsourced by volunteers and working completely in the open - in the public domain - the Center for Humane Technology takes a top-down, strategic approach. Over the past year, Tristan Harris et al. have had tremendous success at the highest levels of politics and in the boardrooms of the big tech companies.

Their strategic pillars until now were:

1. Trigger a Cultural Awakening
2. Create Political Pressure
3. Engage Employees at the Workfloor
4. Promote Humane Design

Today you will hear the details on what these strategies entail, and how CHT is going to act on them. The year 2019 will be an exciting year for tech!

Initially the Humane Tech Community had adopted the same strategic pillars, but after our current reorganization where we are [Building the Pyramids of Humane Technology](https://community.humanetech.com/t/3322) this is what our relationship looks like:

**You will see that both the Center for Humane Technology and the Humane Tech Community will provide a positive path forward, where we look to the future with optimism, and determination to find great solutions to the many tech-related challenges we have to solve. And solve them we will!**
